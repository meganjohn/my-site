        <h2>Let's Talk Anxiety</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Brains are funny old things, aren't they? Somehow every human on this
        planet has the same anatomy and yet they all function differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roughly 1 in 100 people will be diagnosed with a mental illness at some
        point in their life which is an incredibly large number of people when
        you really stop to consider it. I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety
        Disorder while at university and going through an especially tough time
        with an exam that seemed created for me to fail but, looking back, it
        seems that I've been struggling with it for as long as I can remember.
        For a long time, I kept it secret and told almost no-one what I was
        coming to terms with and trying to overcome daily but now, 5 years on
        from that time, I aim to be as vocal and open about my mental health as
        possible. People will continue to keep it quiet and the stigma will
        continue.
      </p>

        Only by speaking up and having open conversations with those 99 out of
        100 people who have never, and will never, experience a mental illness
        will we create a world where individuals are no longer judged, accused
        of exaggerating, or treated in any way as less of a capable individual
        by those around them because of their diagnosis. To anyone who may be
        reading this and has previously allowed themselves to stigmatise anyone
        else because of mental illness, let me clarify:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="centered">
      <p class="main-body emphasised">
        I am no less capable because of my mental illness.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-body">
      <p>
        You may find it uncomfortable that it still needs saying but the reality
        of a life with mental illness is that too many people still don't fully
        understand that mental health doesn't define us. Sure, it can make days
        harder and we can face challenges that others don't, but the fact that
        we continue to wake up day after day and do whatever we can physically
        and mentally manage is an amazing thing. I have developed a strength and
        resilience that I wouldn't have known was possible until I experienced
        the worst anxiety that I have faced so far. Getting up and going to
        lectures every morning after sitting up for hours having panic, and
        anxiety, attacks night after night was the most courageous and strong
        thing that I've done in my life so far.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that university is a few years behind me, and I'm well into a
        full-time role, I've found my anxiety creeping up on me again; only this
        time I wasn't going to let it be a secret. It started small: I told my
        partner, my parents and my doctor. I got medication and registered for
        therapy (there'll be a post on my experience of CBT in the future) and I
        found the bravery to confide in my line manager about what was going on.
        From that point on, I've become more open in my life and around work
        about my mental health and am becoming more comfortable with turning
        down social invites without any more of an explanation than 'my mental
        health really isn't up to it today, but thanks for the invite'.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-body">
      <p>
        And the thing that I've found is that, while many people may not fully
        comprehend the reality of living with a mental illness, the general
        perception is shifting. As a generation, we're becoming more aware and
        understanding of mental health as just a vital part of our wellbeing as
        our physical health. Colleagues are more comfortable engaging in
        discussions about challenging emotional situations and overwhelming
        thoughts. Some of my co-workers will still make comments that are far
        more hinderance than help, but it's commonly a manifestation of
        misplaced support rather than from a place of no understanding or even
        malice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mental health will likely continue being an area of medicine that is not
        well understood which can largely be considered due to its amorphous
        nature: no two people's experience of the same diagnosis will be exactly
        the same. One person's trigger may be another person's mental comfort
        and we can't expect everyone around us to be walking on egg-shells for
        fear of setting you off, but what we can do is continue becoming more
        open about our individual experiences and helping those close to us to
        understand how they can best support us and how to avoid any big
        triggers. We are getting there. It may take telling someone in several
        different ways and getting help from others to educate them too but my
        experience has so far been one of an increasingly accepting and
        understanding generation with regards to mental health, and that can
        only be a good thing.
