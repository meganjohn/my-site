        <h2>My Thoughts on Anxiety</h2>
      </div>
    <p>
      Brains are funny old things, aren't they? Somehow every human on this planet has the same anatomy and yet they all function differently.
      <break></break>
      Roughly 1 in 100 people will be diagnosed with a mental illness at some point in their life which is an incredibly large number of people when you really stop to consider it.  
      I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder while at university and going through an especially tough time with an exam that seemed created for me to fail but, 
      looking back, it seems that I've been struggling with it for as long as I can remember.  
      For a long time, I kept it secret and told almost no-one what I was coming to terms with and trying to overcome daily but now, 5 years on from that time, 
      I aim to be as vocal and open about my mental health as possible.  People will continue to keep it quiet and the stigma will continue.

      Only by speaking up and having open conversations with those 99 out of 100 people who have never, and will never, experience a mental illness will we create a world where 
      individuals are no longer judged, accused of exaggerating, or treated in any way as less of a capable individual by those around them because of their diagnosis.  
      To anyone who may be reading this and has previously allowed themselves to stigmatise anyone else because of mental illness, let me clarify:
